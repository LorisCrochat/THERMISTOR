## Description

This library allows you to measure temperature using a Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) thermistor. It provides a class for converting analog readings to temperature in Kelvin, Celsius, or Fahrenheit, using the properties of the thermistor and a voltage divider circuit.

## Features

- Easy integration with Arduino, ESP32, and similar microcontrollers.
- Support for customizable thermistor and circuit parameters.
- Accurate conversion of analog-to-digital readings to temperature.

## Schematic

Below is a simple schematic for connecting a thermistor:
